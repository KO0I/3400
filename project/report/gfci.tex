\section{Introduction}

Ground Fault Circuit Interrupts (GFCI's or GFI's) are a type of protection
circuit commonly seen in bathrooms, kitchens and outdoor power sockets. Their
existence is to reduce the risk of a lethal electrical shock, such as a
toaster being dropped in a bathtub full of water. Most circuit breakers are
intended to handle very large currents [cite], but a lethal electric shock can
occur at very small currents as small as a few milliamps [cite].
